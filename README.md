# A Classroom for Swift 3.0 on Linux
Classroom experiments for exploring Swift 3.0 programming on Linux

This project will contain multiple classroom expirments as I try to get familiar with Swift 3.0 running on Linux and how it differs from programming Swift 2.2 on Linux iOS/OSX in Xcode.

My Linux Swift environment consists of Gentoo hosting an Ubuntu 15.10 Docker container with the Swift 3.0 (swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-04-25-a) package installed.
